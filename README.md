# Greenfield Contracts
Greenfield Contracts is the bridge between Greenfield and BSC for cross-chain communication.

## Key Features
1. **CrossChain**. The underlying cross-chain communication protocol. This contract is responsible for handling 
all aspects of cross-chain communication packages, including their sending, handling, encoding, and decoding.

2. **GovHub**. This contract oversees all aspects of contract upgrades, parameter adjustments, and handles governance
requests originating from the `Greenfield`. Additionally, it validates and executes governance proposals as required.

3. **TokenHub**. This contract is tasked with handling cross-chain transactions, encompassing both `transferIn` and 
`transferOut`. Upon initiating a cross-chain transfer from the `Greenfield` to the BSC, tokens are initially locked within 
the `TokenHub`, subsequently triggering a cross-chain transfer event. Awaiting a relayer to facilitate the event, 
the transaction is relayed to the `Greenfield`.

## Contribution
Thank you for considering helping with the source code! We appreciate contributions from anyone on the internet, no
matter how small the fix may be.

If you would like to contribute to Greenfield, please follow these steps: fork the project, make your changes, commit them,
and send a pull request to the maintainers for review and merge into the main codebase. However, if you plan on submitting
more complex changes, we recommend checking with the core developers first via GitHub issues (we will soon have a Discord channel)
to ensure that your changes align with the project's general philosophy. This can also help reduce the workload of both
parties and streamline the review and merge process.
