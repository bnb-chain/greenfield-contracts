# Greenfield Contracts
Greenfield Contracts is the bridge between Greenfield and BSC for cross-chain communication.

## Overview
The Greenfield Blockchain provides a comprehensive set of resources that can be mirrored on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).
This includes buckets, objects, and groups, which can be stored and managed on the BSC as non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
conforming to the ERC-721 standard.

A bucket is a logical container for storing objects in Greenfield. An object, on the other hand, is a fundamental unit
of storage in Greenfield that represents a file consisting of data and its associated metadata.
Lastly, a group is a collection of accounts with the same permissions.

These resources can be mirrored on the BSC as ERC-721 NFTs, along with the members within a group, which represent
permissions to specify resources, that can be mirrored as ERC-1155 token. At present, the NFTs are not transferable,
but the transferability feature will be added in the near future.

Once these resources are mirrored on BSC, they can be directly managed by smart contracts on BSC.
These operations will directly affect the storage format, access permissions, and other aspects of the data on greenfield.
In other words, any changes made to the decentralized application on BSC will also reflect changes on Greenfield.
This integration between Greenfield Blockchain and BNB Smart Chain allows for greater flexibility and accessibility
when it comes to accessing and manipulating data, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and efficient
data management process.

## Key Contract
1. **CrossChain**. The underlying cross-chain communication protocol. This contract is responsible for handling
   all aspects of cross-chain communication packages, including verification, encoding, decoding, routing, reward distribution.
2. **GovHub**. This contract oversees all aspects of contract upgrades, parameter adjustments, and handles governance
   requests originating from the `Greenfield`. Additionally, it validates and executes governance proposals as required.
3. **TokenHub**. This contract is tasked with handling cross-chain transactions, encompassing both `transferIn` and
   `transferOut`. Upon initiating a cross-chain transfer from the `Greenfield` to the BSC, tokens are initially locked within
   the `TokenHub`, subsequently triggering a cross-chain transfer event.
4. **GroupHub**. This contract is responsible for managing the `Greenfield` group,
   including the addition and removal of members.
5. **BucketHub**. This contract is responsible for managing the `Greenfield` buckets.
6. **ObjectHub**. This contract is responsible for managing the `Greenfield` objects.

## Resource Operating Primitives
A number of cross-chain primitives have been defined on BSC to enable developers to manage greenfield resources on the
BSC directly, without the need for intermediaries.

**BNB**:
- transfer BNB bidirectionally between BSC and Greenfield

**Bucket**:
- create a bucket on BSC
- delete a bucket on BSC
- mirror bucket from Greenfield to BSC

**Object**:
- delete an object on BSC
- mirror object from Greenfield to BSC
- grant/revoke permissions of objects on BSC to accounts/groups
- create an object on BSC (pending)
- copy objects on BSC (pending)
- Kick off the execution of an object on BSC (pending)

**Group**:
- create a group on BSC
- delete a group on BSC
- change group members on BSC
- mirror group from Greenfield to BSC

Users can also approve smart contracts to operate the aforementioned resources instead, check the
[design](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/docs/guide/dapp/permisson-control.html) for more details.
